          | Comune is built on the principle of sharing, and driven by the power of food to connect us to each other, to our community, and to the whole planet. Every ingredient we select, every flavor we combine, every menu we prepare, every moment we help create—everything we do and every reason we do it sprouts from a singular and unwavering purpose: 
          i to share.
